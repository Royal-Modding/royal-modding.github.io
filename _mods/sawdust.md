name: Sawdust
desc: Sawdust mod simulates woodchips falling to the ground when cutting down trees or cutting off branches. The woodchips need to be transported or cleaned then. While the chainsaw is in use it is possible to set the dust intensivity between 0(off) and 3(max). It is set to 2 by default. The woodchips will only be generated if the ground allows tipping of material.
